If you already have your virtual environment active (where you installed Flask, OpenCV, etc.), run:

pip freeze > requirements.txt


This will create a file named requirements.txt in your project folder with all dependencies, for example:

Flask==3.0.3
opencv-python==4.10.0.84
pytesseract==0.3.13
spacy==3.7.5
ultralytics==8.3.0
Pillow==10.4.0
numpy==2.1.1
